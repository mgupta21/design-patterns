***Composite Design Pattern***
>> Organization of objects as trees

***Proxy Design Pattern***
>> A client can use proxy to communicate to real object
>> Used when direct object access is not possible due to following reasons : 
    >> Object is not reachable 
        >> lives on another machine
        >> object swapped out to disk
        
    >> Some processing required
        >> security (eg. credentials check)
        >> audit trail
